# Loan risk prediction

This is my midterm project in machine learning Zoomcamp 2023. Please check out my code. Enjoy! :blush:

## Problem
The problem at hand is to develop a loan risk prediction system that assesses the creditworthiness of individuals applying for loans based on their personal information. Preventing loan defaults is crucial for financial institutions and lenders because defaults can have significant negative impacts on their financial health and overall operations. :money_with_wings:

## Goal
The goal is to determine whether an applicant is likely to default on the loan, providing financial institutions with a reliable tool to mitigate risk and make informed lending decisions. :chart_with_upwards_trend:

## Dataset

## EDA/Experiment/Model Selection
[Notebook](Loan_risk_pred.ipynb)
I finally choose ANN(Artificial Nueral Network) Classifier and I save my Preprocessing pipeline and the classifier model here. [Save model packages](model.bin)
